    <h1>What is Cornell Notes?</h1>
    <p>
        Cornell(please aaccept me) Notes is a very popular notetaking method used by many people <br>
        around the world in order to create easily comprehensible notes that are very effective <br>
        for those late-night, or just normal study sessions(I know that you have done them). <br>
        Cornell Notes consist of three sections: The Main Notes Section, where you take your notes, <br>
        the Cue section, where you can put crucial vocabulary terms or central ideas that are <br>
        related to your very important notes. Finally, there is the <i>summary</i> section, where <br>
        you summmarize everything that you have written down. In the end, this notetaking strategy <br>
        can be effective, proving to you that maybe you should change your notes up a bit <br>
        even if you believe that you are taking good notes right now, would you? <br>
